# Dark-Notepad
    This is a recreation of Microsoft's Notepad in C#, and it also supports themes. <br />
    This software was primarily meant to run on Microsoft's Windows 10 and was written in <br />
    C# DOTNET 5.0 using the WinForms library. <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
## Usage
    Just like a regular notepad, open the software and write or read whatever text file you want to. <br />
    There is an option to modify the Text's font and the program's theme! <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
## Stylizing
    As said before there is a Stylizing option: In the software click on `Format` -> `Stylize...` <br />
    There is even a Color Spectrum to choose your colors from! <br />
    <br />

    <br />
## Note before installing
    This software should work on any Windows 10 system with or without dotnet installed. <br />
    Since this software was written in C# it might use higher RAM resources when compared to Microsoft's notepad.
    I do not take any responsibility for any kind of damage this software might cause with unintended uses. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This software was programmed in Visual Studio Community 2022 (.Net 5.0).
> Note: This is an early iteration of this program, so expect limitations with this it.
