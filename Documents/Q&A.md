5. ### I'm saving a file, but the characters inside it look strange and are different from what I tried to save.
   This could be an issue with the program that you use to view the text with or with Dark-Notepad's encoder settings. <br/>

9. ### I'm saving to a batch(.bat) file and the encoder setting doesn't seem to affect the result.
   As of version 1.0.2 batch (.bat) files automatically are encoded with `ASCII` encoder. <br/>
   As a workaround you can save the file with another extension and then rename the file to a .bat extension.

10. ### How do I change the default search engine?
     You can choose a search engine in `Help` -> `View Help` -> `Settings` -> `Search Engine`. <br/>

11. ### When I right click files 'Edit With DarkNotepad' doesn't work or doesn't display.

12. ### When I disable the 'Edit With DarkNotepad' it doesn't disappear from the context menu.
     In `Help` -> `View Help` -> `Settings` -> check and then uncheck the `Registry` setting a few times. <br/>
     each time the software would ask for administrator privileges, pressing `No` would cancel the action.
